## :star2: About the project

This project is a development of a quiz game mobile app.<br>
The objective of this project is to produce a mobile application in the form of a quiz game in order to marry the Kotlin language and the Android Studio IDE.<br>
The user chooses his nickname and is redirected to the main screen of the application where he has the choice between several categories of quizzes. <br>
After selecting a category, the user answers the questions one after the other.<br>
The user has a limited time on each question, at the end of the time allotted, the question counts as a false answer.<br>
At the end of a quiz, a score page is presented with the nicknames and the number of correct answers.
